			<h3 class="step16">Considered to be the oldest dance form in India, Bharatnatyam has essentially originated from Tamil Nadu and is a delightful combination of traditional sadir punched up with expression, music, beat and dance. This form of dance is slow and moving, but at times fast and fluid and hence is also called Fire Dance.The performance repertoire of Bharatanatyam, like other classical dances, includes nrita (pure dance), nritya (solo expressive dance) and natya (group dramatic dance). Bharatanatyam remained exclusive to Hindu temples through the 19th century. A form of illustrative anecdote of Hindu religious themes and spiritual ideas emoted by dancer with excellent footwork and impressive gestures its performance repertoire includes nrita, nritya and natya. Accompanists include a singer, music and particularly the guru who directs and conducts the performance. <a href="https://www.culturalindia.net/indian-dance/classical/bharatnatyam.html">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h3 class="step16">Kathakali’, an important genre in the Indian classical dance form, is associated with storytelling form of this art. It is the dance drama from the south Indian state of Kerala. Similar to other Indian classical dance arts, the story in ‘Kathakali’ is also communicated to audience through excellent footwork and impressive gestures of face and hands complimented with music and vocal performance. However it can be distinguished from the others through the intricate and vivid make-up, unique face masks and costumes worn by dancers as also from their style and movements that reflect the age-old martial arts and athletic conventions prevalent in Kerala and surrounding regions. Traditionally performed by male dancers, it developed in courts and theatres of Hindu regions contrary to other Indian classical dances which predominantly developed in Hindu temples and monastic schools. Although not clearly traceable, this classical dance form is considered to have originated from temple and folk arts that trace back to 1st millennium CE or before.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathakali">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h3 class="step16">Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.Evidence of Kuchipudi's existence in an older version are found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the Machupalli Kaifat.[8][9] Kuchipudi tradition holds that Tirtha Narayana Yati – a sanyassin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion,and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century.Kuchipudi largely developed as a Hindu god Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition,and it is most closely related to Bhagavata Mela.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuchipudi">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<o class="step15"></o><a name="Kathak">
			<h3 class="step16">Kathak is one of the eight major forms of Indian classical dance. The origin of Kathak is traditionally attributed to the traveling bards in the northern areas of Ancient India known as Kathakars or storytellers.The term Kathak is derived from the Vedic Sanskrit word Katha which means "story", and Kathakar which means "the one who tells a story", or "to do with stories".Wandering Kathakars communicated stories from the great epics and ancient mythology through dance, songs and music.Kathak dancers tell various stories through their hand movements and extensive footwork, their body movements and flexibility but most importantly through their facial expressions. Kathak evolved during the Bhakti movement, particularly by incorporating the childhood and stories of the Hindu god Krishna, as well as independently in the courts of north Indian kingdoms.Kathak is unique in having both Hindu and Muslim gharanas and cultural elements of these gharanas.Kathak performances include Urdu Ghazals and commonly used instruments brought during the Mughal period.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathak">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h3 class="step16">Mohiniyattam, (Malayalam: മോഹിനിയാട്ടം), is an Indian classical dance form that developed and remained popular in the state of Kerala.Kathakali is another classical dance form of Kerala.Mohiniyattam dance gets its name from the word Mohini – a historical enchantress avatar of the Hindu god Vishnu, who helps the good prevail over evil by developing her feminine powers.Mohiniyattam's roots, like all classical Indian dances, are in the Natya Shastra – the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text on performance arts.However, it follows the Lasya style described in Natya Shastra, that is a dance which is delicate, eros-filled and feminine.It is traditionally a solo dance performed by women after extensive training. The repertoire of Mohiniyattam includes music in the Carnatic style, singing and acting a play through the dance, where the recitation may be either by a separate vocalist or the dancer herself. The song is typically in Malayalam-Sanskrit hybrid called Manipravalam.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohiniyattam">To get more Information click here</a></h3>

			<h3 class="step16">The Raas Leela, also referred to as Manipuri Dance, is one of the major Indian classical dance forms, originating from the state of Manipur.[1] The dance form is based on Hindu Vaishnavism themes, and exquisite performances of love-inspired dance drama of Radha-Krishna called Raas Leela.

The roots of the Manipuri Raas Leela dance, as with all classical Indian dances, is the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, with influences and the culture fusion between various local folk dance forms. With evidence of Vishnu temples in the medieval era, this dance form have been passed down verbally from generation to generation as an oral tradition.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manipuri_Raas_Leela#:~:text=The%20Raas%20Leela%2C%20also%20referred,Radha%2DKrishna%20called%20Raas%20Leela.">To get more Information click here</a></h3>
